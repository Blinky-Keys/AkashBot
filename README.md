Thank you for choosing AkashBot :)
I appreciate any feedback, so feel free to create issues in the repo and I will see to them as soon as I can.

Below are all the commands for AkashBot

&join - Get the bot to join a voice channel. The person that summons the bot must also be in a voice channel before summoning bot.

&leave - Make the bot leave the voice channel that it is currently in. The person commanding the bot must also be in the voice channel

&fuckoff - Make the bot leave using unnecessarily rude language. The bot may or may not talk back to you. The person telling the bot to f*ck off must also be in the voice channel.

&SNA - Make the bot join the voice channel and play the Soviet National Anthem. If you're lucky, the other people in the channel won't have changed the bot's volume from it's default of 100% and you can laugh at them. The person summoning the bot must also be in the voice channel.

&whoisfat - You will have no use for this command unless a very specific person is in your server.

&help - Makes the bot send you a DM listing all of the commands, though if you're reading this file then you don't need this command.

&play - Get the bot to play music to the whole voice channel. The person summoning the bot must be in a voice channel and also use a YouTube link to specify which song they want the bot to play.

&skip - Make the bot skip the song that is currently playing. The user skipping the song must be in a voice channel too.

&stop - Make the bot stop playing all audio in the voice channel. The bot will remain in the channel, and the user must also be in the voice channel.

&ping - Get the bot's ping in milliseconds.



Future Features

YOUTUBE SEARCHING

I am hoping to add YouTube searching to the bot, so that any user will be able to simply type "&play SONG_NAME" and the bot will search YouTube and play the first result, without the user needing to go to youtube and find the link themself.


CUSTOM INSULTS

Another feature I would like the bot to have is the ability to add custom insults that can be directed to other users. This might be a while coming.
